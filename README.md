# Wanderlust Frontend

This is the frontend application for Wanderlust Travels, built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- The **Wanderlust Backend** should be running for full functionality.

## Setup & Installation

1.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Environment Configuration**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory (`wanderlust-travels/.env`) to configure the backend connection:

    ```env
    # URL of your running backend API
    VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
    
    # Optional: Google Gemini API Key for AI features
    VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
    ```

## Running the Application

### Development Mode
Starts the development server with hot-reloading.
```bash
npm run dev
```
Access the app at `http://localhost:3001`.

### Production Build
Builds the application for production and allows you to preview it locally.

1.  **Build**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This creates a `dist` folder containing the static files.

2.  **Preview**
    ```bash
    npm run preview
    ```
    This serves the built application at `http://0.0.0.0:3001`.

## Deployment
To deploy, simply upload the contents of the `dist` folder (generated by `npm run build`) to any static hosting service (Vercel, Netlify, AWS S3, Nginx, etc.).
